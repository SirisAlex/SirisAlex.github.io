        <p>
            I have experience making games as well as interactive experiences.
            I am proficient with the Unity and Unreal engines, and also with C# and C++ code.
            I also have experience with designing workflows in Figma and assets in photoshop, with some modeling experience in Maya.

            Whenever I am not programming or gaming, I enjoy writing stories and thinking up
            new characters. I particularly enjoy the process of designing cool future scenarios for potential projects.
            You will always find new ideas banging around in my head.

            <strong>Syllo</strong><br>
            Syllo is a game created in one week for the Brackeys Game Jam 2025 on Itch.io. I was lead
            developer of the game and worked around the clock to design layouts,
            implement player interaction, and guide the player through their tasks to reach
            the end of the game. In just one week, we managed to implement three days of story-driven
            content, 10-20 unique task designs, and 15 emails full of juicy dialogue.

            <strong>Wilderwood</strong><br>
            Wilderwood is a 3D collectathon made in Unity by me and a group of friends. As lead UI
            Designer/Developer, I was in charge of prototyping and refining the look and feel of the
            our interface. The design is simple and rustic looking, which I thought best fit the
            elements of our casual experience, and after multiple iterations, I streamlined the design
            to give the player the information they needed without being too crowded and messy.

            <strong>Doots Never Die</strong><br>
            Doots Never Die is a game made in Unity in fall 2021 by me and a team of RIT students.
            The game is a top-down shooter where you're fighting against the clock to
            scare as many kids as possible on Halloween night. The game was
            programmed in Unity and published with WebGL.
            My role in Doots Never Die was on the enemy AI of the children in the game. I had
            to figure out how the enemies would react to the player's position at all times and 
            carefully balance their speed and aggressiveness to make the game challenging, but fair.

                <strong>Submerged</strong>
                Submerged is a Unity game designed in spring 2021 by me and a team of developers.
                The game is a physics-based platformer taking place entirely underwater.
                I was a lead level designer and programmer for the game, determining the
                flow of player movement and designing some of the more interesting mechanics
                of our grappling hook, such as the slingshot and hanging onto moving objects.
